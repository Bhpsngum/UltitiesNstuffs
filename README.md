Some funny codes that will be helpful in some specific cases

Some of them are derived from my own extension and mod code, also from other sources if they're interesting

## [getProperJSVariableName.js](getProperJSVariableName.js):

Syntax: ```string.getProperVariableName(mode)``` where `mode` is "strict" or none

Return value: a string that can be set as JS Variable from your input string 

For example: 
```js
> "It's my funny variable name".getProperVariableName()
"It_s_my_funny_variable_name"
> "69 likes!".getProperVariableName()
"_69_likes_"
> "let".getProperVariableName()
"let"
> "let".getProperVariableName("strict")
"_let"
```
Uses: in my extension (Ship Editor sections) where users can name their ship like "69 is Legendary!" or "The 'Little' Hamster" and the modexport code return like
```js
var 69_is_Legendary!_696 = '{/*something*/}';
var The_'Little'_Hamster_969 = '{/*even more thing*/}'
```
which will return the `Unexpected identifier error` when it came to Modding. So that how the code works: just edit the variable to a proper JS variable name :D
